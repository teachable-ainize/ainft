LORE OF THE BUFFICORN
The unicorn may be a good representation of rarity and value for the VC community, but it isn’t a great representation of the ethos of Web3. After all, when was the last time anyone saw a unicorn with other unicorns (or any other animal for that matter)? Never. The trouble is the unicorn is a solitary creature basking in its mystery alone..

Then there’s the buffalo, a herd animal that runs with its community, but it isn’t known for magic or majesty.

Legend has it that centuries ago, in order to resolve a dispute between the unicorns and the buffalo, a treaty was formed to create a new species of community-oriented, magical, fantastical animals: the Bufficorn.

The Bufficorn (monocerus magicalis bisonae) portrays the best of both worlds regarding personality traits. They #BUIDL for positive-sum outcomes and encourage the expression of unique creativity by each member of the community.

The Bufficorn #BUIDL Brigade is an expression of what it means to “be a Bufficorn” and to be passionate about #BUIDLing the decentralized future.
